This was my first project for Get Coding NL, and my first foray in the world of front-end coding. 

It was created using HTML5, CSS, and JS.

##About Word Wizard

Word wizard is a random word generator. It pulls a random quote upon loading the main page. 

When you are ready to get your word, the "get word" takes you where you need to go.

Random words are pulled from either an array I created, or from a [random word api](https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com) via asyncronous functions. The words are given a random font and a random color (also stored in arrays).
